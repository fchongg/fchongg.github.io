       	Hi & Welcome!
       	First of all, thank you for taking your time to stop by!

       	I'm currently a fourth year computer science student. I believe that technology has created many unbelievable opportunities for us. Artificial intelligence has always been a subject that I've been extremely fond of and I'm ecstatic in what it can deliver to us! Please contact me at: fchongg@gmail.com.

        <blockquote>
        Visual weight revolves around the idea that distinct elements in a design have varying heaviness relative to each other. 
        Sometimes visual weight is obvious, such as in the case where larger objects appear heavier than smaller objects because they take up more space. 
        In certain instances, itâ€™s not so cut and dry, such as in the case of color. Some colors may look as if they are heavier and more dominant than others.
